    <p style="text-align:left; background-color: whitesmoke"> Hello, Everyone! My name is Anam. I graduated in Software Engineering from University of Management and Technology. Currently, I am working as a Front end "Web development" and building my skills in web development. After my graduation, I explored different opportunities to study Abroad and invested my time in volunteer work to improve my Marketing skills and team work skills but the path that I decided did not worked out so, It made me realised that I am interested in web development now, I am looking for opportunities to learn Web development and want to work with seniors to learn more about this filed. </p>
